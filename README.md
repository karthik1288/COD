# COD
Development directory for iOS development


The app we are proposing is C.O.D (Code name for conversation on demand).

This idea came to my mind when am facing difficulties in coding for one of the courses at IIT. You might face a problem and couldn't find someone to help you in your reach. So this app does that for you. It broadcasts the problem to every expert in the problem area.Once the problem is solved you can affirm expertise of the person you got help from. So more the affirmations more the expert you are (It is like playing a game and come across some problems and gearing up levels). And the second dimension of it is user can login as a recruiter,and see the experts and reach out to them.

Well, that is just the academic perspective of COD!! Well the uses of CODs are endless! We can not just meet experts/ you can date the smart guys(Well...girls too!).

So lets start and make a conversation on demand!
